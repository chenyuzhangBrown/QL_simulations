# Quasi-linear Simulations of Annular Pipe Flows
In this paper, we simulate annular pipe flows with the open-source python package Dedalus. We would like to study the transition to turbulence with the results of these simulations. Both the Fully nonlinear (NL) and the Quasi-linear (QL) models are simulated.
## QL_simulation
This folder contains the scripts for simulations for the Quasi-linear approximation at different pressure gradients.
## NL simulation
This folder contains the scripts for simulations for the fully nonlinear model at different pressure gradients.
## Analysis
This folder contains all the scripts for data analysis. Including plotting the power spectra, streamwise vorticities, kinetic energy, and the turbulence fraction.
