# Quasi-linear Simulations of Annular Pipe Flows
In this paper, we simulate annular pipe flows with the open-source python package Dedalus. We would like to study the transition to turbulence with the results of these simulations. Both the Fully nonlinear (NL) and the Quasi-linear (QL) models are simulated.
